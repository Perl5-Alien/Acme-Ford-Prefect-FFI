NAME
    Acme::Ford::Prefect - FFI test module for Alien::Base

SYNOPSIS
     use Acme::Ford::Prefect;
 
     my $answer = Acme::Ford::Prefect::answer(); # == 42 of course

DESCRIPTION
    Alien::Base comprises base classes to help in the construction of
    "Alien::" modules. Modules in the Alien namespace are used to locate and
    install (if necessary) external libraries needed by other Perl modules.

    This module is a toy module to test the efficacy of the Alien::Base
    system with its experimental FFI interfaces. This module depends on
    another toy module Acme::Alien::DontPanic which provides the needed
    libdontpanic library to be able to tell us the "answer" to life, the
    universe and everythin.
